### Text Editors

A text editor is where you are able to make changes to the the website you are editing. You can either:
* Download and install a text editor

or 

* Use your browser's text editor

Choose a text editor where you feel like you can get the most work done. Whichever text editor you choose, make sure that you're really comfortable with it -- try experimenting with different ones. 

Make sure you look into these:

- Code completion
- Emmet
- Syntax Highlighting
- Themes
