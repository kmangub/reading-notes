### Growth Mindset

> Growth mindset is where an individual is open for change. Knowledge has no bounds!

There are three things that I think about to remind myself about having a growth mindset:

* I should **accept critisism** and not ignore it
* I should **always challenge myself** with task and learn from them
* I should always **be inspired**
